# FooBar

This repo contains solutions for a selection of challenges from
Google's FooBar recruitment project. Solutions are sorted by level,
and contain the two original test cases given for each challenge.
Solutions that pass both test cases have also passed submission to
Google (passing all hidden test cases), and with the exception of a
few snippets, all work is original.

**Warning:** Solutions are currently published in Python 3, however
Google will attempt to run solutions in version 2.7.13 during
verification. Therefore, some solutions may require minor alterations
in order to run successfully, or pass all test cases.
